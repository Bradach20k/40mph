#### Yet another blog hosting miscellaneous writings about writings on politics, books, and culture.

##### Why Reading at 40mph?

The phrase *reading at 40mph* is based on this passage from Henry Brokmeyer's extraordinary *A Mechanic's Diary*:
> *July 11, 1856*

> I have recommenced my anual course in Hegel's "Logic." It is a strange book and attractive to me, on account of its noiselessness. Whenever the world within or without commences to brawl so loudly that I cannot hear my own voice, I take a journey into the realm of this primeval solitude. I sometimes think it is a great pity that the man did not live to-day, or at least at a time when the railroad facilities were far enough developed to show him what a book ought to be for man when he travels by steam. As it is, I don’t know of a single chapter, page or paragraph that can be read and understood in passing by it at the moderate rate of speed of, say, forty miles an hour, no matter how large the letters might be made, or how long the fence to give room for their display. [^1]

Our need to find quietude in a world of ever-increasing speed has become something of cliché, perhaps, and the pursuit is as old as antiquity. It may seem Brokmeyer makes an elementary mistake, seeking such quietude in theory, instead of in some form of contemplative practice. Who finds quietude in Hegel, the philosopher of modernity *par excellence*?  

##### Who am I?

Hi, I'm Brady. I'm a library worker in the Denver area. If you find any additional insight into I am, please contact me to let me know: beyond this I am as confused as you are. 

##### Who's responsible for the theme?
John Coene designed this theme, Marat, based on the French radical newspaper. Check it out [here](https://github.com/JohnCoene/marat).
